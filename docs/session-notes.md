**Session focus**: Memory system explanation and project setup

**What was done**:
- Explained Claude Code's memory system (4-tier hierarchy)
- Reviewed currently loaded memories (user + project CLAUDE.md)
- Created TODO.md and docs/session-notes.md for better context persistence

**Key decisions**:
- TODO.md lives at project root (not `tasks/TODO.md`)
- Session notes go to `docs/session-notes.md`
- Future ideas from CLAUDE.md moved to TODO.md for tracking

**Next session**:
- Continue with any of the TODO items (quick start, deep start, memory prompt)
